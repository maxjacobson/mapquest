* an option to tweet/facebook how you did

### meta

## development diary

### 2013-11-01

* I've created a repository
* I've created a README
* I've switched the primary branch from `master` to `gh-pages`, which I'll consider the master branch for now so it will show up online at <http://maxjacobson.github.io/mapquest>
